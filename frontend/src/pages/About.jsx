                Hi, I’m Brody. I’m an undergraduate computer science student at UofT. I built this site to make it easier for students like me to find housing near campus. I was tired of switching between different websites just to find listings, and then having to look up each address on Google Maps to see how far it was from school. This site puts everything in one place. It pulls listings from multiple sources and shows helpful details like walk times, prices, and more. Hopefully it saves you some time (and tabs).
